        That Person from Your Math Exam That Finishes Way Too Soon
    </h1>
	<article>
		<header>
		This person from your exam room finishes all their work in about a
        third of the amount of time the entire class was given. It is not
        known why this individual acts in such a manner, however many theories
        exist on the matter.

                        Some, but not all of the proposed explanations include:
                        <ul>
                            <li> The individual is conceding an early defeat to the exam </li>
                            <li>The individual is overly confident in their performance on the exam</li>
                            <li>The individual has no clue of what is going on and wants to get the exam out of their hands</li>
                            <li>The individual has to deliver a child</li>
                            <li>The individual is playing an intricate game of social image projection and is attempting the reap the benefits of seeming smart regardless of their ability to do well on the exam</li>
                            <li>The individual intends to gain an advantage by wasting the times of others in the class by making them wonder as to how they finished so quickly.</li>
                            <li>The individual harbors a great hate for all other humankind and would like them all to burn</li>

                    Disputes to common theories include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Given the person is unacquainted with the material, they may yet benefit using the entire timeframe for the exam</li>
                        <li>Given the individual is delivering a child, it does not compute that the child would be so rude as to pick such an inconvenient time to require delivery</li>
                        <li>They're probably just done</li>
