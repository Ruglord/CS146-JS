	Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle

		Heisenberg was a famous scientist that rose to fame by pure chance. In an attempt to cover up the fact that he really knew nothing, Heisenberg came up with the uncertanty principle that basically states that 
		nobody knows anything so it's normal for him to know nothing.

				Unique Mathematical Properties

					<ul>
						<li>The Uncertainty Principle is one of the few equations that is equal to its integral, derivative, absolute value, and square root. </li>
						<li> Any number can be divided by the Uncertainty Principle for extra uncertainty. </li>
						<li> The sign of the value of x is "uncertain"; it's neither positive nor negative. </li>
						<li> The principle is the one and only possible y-value for every x-intercept in every equation. </li>
