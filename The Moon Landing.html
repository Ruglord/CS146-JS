				The Moon Landing or The Apollo 11 project seen on television in 1969 on the 20<sup>th</sup> of July was indeed staged. The project was conceived when president JFK discovered the USSR planned to build a nuclear bomb shelter on the moon. At this time the only country to ever successfully put a man on the moon was <a href= "Elon Musk.html">SPACE-X</a>. Determined to undermine Vladimir Putin, JFK decided to stage a moon landing in hopes the USSR would give up after they thought America got there first.

						Steven Spielberg was the first choice for director, but he would only agree to sign the non-disclosure agreement if he was given complete artistic control. The United States agreed to cover the costs using all the money they wouldâ€™ve spent on launches. Because the team behind project Apollo was so committed to the realism of the final cut, they shot it on the moon and used the natural scenery. The total cost of making the film was around $126 billion after Neil Armstrong demanded a bigger trailer.

						Upon discovering this JFK and Steven Spielberg never collaborated on another project until 1969 when Spielberg agreed to help the president fake his own death. Because the project went over its estimated budget by 900% America was on the brink of the very same economic decline as the USSR. Luckily under president <del>Richard</del> Nixon America was able to cover its losses by borrowing the money from China.
