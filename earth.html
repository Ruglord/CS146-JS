		Earth is the 3rd planet in the solar system, after Mercury and Sun. Earth is named after the Greek God Earthos, the Greek God for life. He was the third
		son of the first god Firstgodos, whose other sons, Mercurious and Sunos, are the names of the first 2 planets of our solar system. Earth is the only planet
		known to harbor life.

					There has been much debate as to the shape of the Earth. Some have proposed a spherical shape; after all, that would make sense given the shape
					of the other planets, as well as the laws of physics and photographic evidence. However, <del>mob</del> popular logic has instead shown that 
					Earth is in fact the shape of a velociraptor. It's the only plausible explanation for the poles (a direct result of the velociraptor's complicated
					bipolar personality), the sun and moon cycles (the velociraptor chases and hunts moon at night and hunts the sun in the morning.), and so much
					more. There is a small minority of most of the scientific community that still insists the planet is in fact round, citing numerous studies and
					natural phenomena. However, they have all been passed off by the rest of the rational humans as "wrong", "sheep", or "autistic retards 
					controlled by the government". After all, the majority opinion > other people's opinions.
