		Laundary is clothes and linens that need to be washed or have  been newly washed. So laundry is clothes.

						There are 9 simple yet extremely tedious tasks to do your laundry.
                        Step One: Read the Label. Be sure to check the care labels on your garments and linens (Nobody does this). Step Two: Sort (Not necessary). Step Three: Choose a Detergent. Step Four: Pick a Washer Water Temperature and Cycle (Does not really matter which one you choose). Step Five: One Final Check (Nobody does this). Step Six: Load the Washer. Step Seven: Unload the Washer. Step Eight: Load the Dryer. Step 9: Hang and Fold(Optional)

						Detergent is one of the most important parts to laundry. Getting a good detergent only enhances the entire cleaning process. And theres nothing like ones that acts as a good snack as well! That's why people love Tide Pods. Put one in the washer and put one in your mouth. Lunadry and dinner all at once. A lot of people also use Tide Pods because everything is a Tide ad. (DISCLAIMER- TIDE PODS ARE NOT EDIBLE.  DO NOT EAT)
