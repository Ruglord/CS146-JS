		The golden ratio is a significant weird spiral thingy which is observed in every single thing that exists.
        Two numbers are in the golden ratio if the ratio between them is the same as the ratio between the greater
        of the two numbers and their sum. This natural formula dictates many of the events that occur in the world.

                        The golden ratio was discovered by Mike Borowski of Monsters Institute of Technology in 2017.
                        Borowski was looking at a renaissance painting and recognized on a whim that all art made up
                        until that point followed an ambiguous inward curve shape. He put the golden ratio over
                        several images to confirm this theory, which, of course, held true.
