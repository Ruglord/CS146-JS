					Description
				</h3>
					<div class = "detailBody">
					Evolution created all life on Earth. Unforunately, he was black-out drunk the whole time so many of his creations are weird and/or inefficient. Given that he's had 3.5 billion years to practice, Evolution
					isn't really that good at his job.

				Examples of Poor Design				
				</h3>
					<div class = "detailBody">
						<ul>
							<li>Platypi have a duckbill, lay eggs, and are venomous.</li>
							<li> Most of life rests on an enzyme called Rubisco due to its ability to convert Carbon Dioxide into Oxygen. Evolution, after a night of hardcore partying, decided to make this all-important
							enzyme incredibly inefficent and slow. When he woke up the next morning, he fixed the problem not by fixing Rubisco, but by making more Rubisco.</li>
							<li> Humans grow wisdom teeth that serve no function and are often detrimental to health </li>
							<li> Pandas need porn to give birth </li>
							<li> Evolution gave elephants size as a defense mechanism, but if they fall, they die. </li>
