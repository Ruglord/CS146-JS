					Stages/Progression
				</h3>
					<div class = "detailBody">
						<h5>
							Stage 0
						</h5>
							The patient doesn't have cancer.
						<h5>
							Stage 1
						</h5>
							Patient begins to develop a longing for the ocean and salt water and dreams of a different life of eating fish, shedding a shell, and moving sideways. 
						<h5>
							Stage 2
						</h5>
							A minor hardening on the skin of the patient is detected. The patient feels a slightly stronger urge to consume seafood, raw or cooked.
						<h5>
						Stage 3
						</h5>
						This is the stage where cancer is most detectable. Major portions of the skin are beginning to harden into a reddish shell, and the fingers begin to fuse together into claws. The urge for seafood
							is unsatiable.
						<h5>
						Stage 4
						</h5>
							Patient is functionally a crab. It can scuttle, eat, and breed with other crabs.

					Extent of infection
				</h3>
					<div class = "detailBody">
						Cancer is an extremely common disease: just look at all the crabs you see at the beach. Every single one is a cancer patient, suffering from the slow and inevitable metamorphosis into a crab.
						Just to put into perspective the amount of cancer infections there are, scientists estimate that there are some 207 billion crabs that have ever walked this planet, which is already at least 
						twice the amount of humans that have ever existed. Paleontologists have even found crab fossils dating some 360 million years ago, suggesting that cancer somehow even infected not-yet-existing
						humans.

				<h3>
					Treatment
				</h3>
					<div class = "detailBody">
						Treatment is still faulty at best but progress is being made. The currently most commonly used treatment is crabotherapy, where the patient is injected full of fish oil in an attempt to ward off the
						crabby symptoms. Results include metamorphosis into a fish (0%) and death (100%).
