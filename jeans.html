						Not only do jeans show the pride in a person's self, but they also can never go bad. Unlike milk, eggs, or meat, people will find jeans even cooler when they go bad. People find rips in jeans more  attractive and coffee stains make you look like a man. People could even start a business of buying a pair of jeans at retail price, completely destroying it, and selling it for a higher price. Jeans truly have no expiration date.
