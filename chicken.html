						Domestication of the chicken dates back to at least 2000 B.C. Their ancestry can be traced back to four species of wild jungle fowl from Southeast Asia. Studies have expressed doubt in the idea that chickens' ancestors are the junglefowl simply because the junglefowl had a purpose in its life other than providing humans with their meat. Junglefowl also were not used as a synonymous term for coward. The chicken belongs to the genus Gallus of the family Phasianidae. Domestic chickens are simply classified as Gallus domesticus. Humans felt bad for the useless creatures and decided to give them a more intelligent sounding name.

						In an attempt to make this planet a more intelligent one, humans gain more than food from just killing these innocent yet space-filling creatures. They're making an effort to  make the world a smarter place. Will we run out of chickens? Humans kill around 9  billion chickens every year and it does not seem like they're running out.
