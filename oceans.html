						<h5>
							Salinity
						</h5>
						The Oceans are characterized by their high salinity, which is a surprise to no one because they are just large bodies of salt. As a result, oceans are the main locations of peanut plantations, as the peanuts
						grow up already salted. Gamers also often come here to yell at people or, as some call it, "get salty".
						<h5>
							Depth
						</h5>
						The oceans, in sharp contrast with their sister land structures, the salt plains,  are of magnificent depth. It is hypothesized that the deepest portions of the ocean reach down to the ocean's core
						where the salt is melted and eventually transported back to the surface via convection currents. There, they are deposited and form blocks of salt rocks.
